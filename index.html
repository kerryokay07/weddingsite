    <h1>our story</h1>
    <div class="bodyText">
        <h3 class="bodyText">Kerry and Hera first met at UCLA their senior year, where they were coincidentally in the same class and has the same internship. They started hanging out and Kerry thought it was cute when Hera said she could beat him at Mario Kart and Hera thought Kerry was the nicest person when he brought over some ice cream she was craving it one night. <br /><br />
        Games and food were only the first connection they found together, soon their love blossomed. <br /><br />
        It spanned over many years and through many different cities. They lived together and apart all over the US, from Los Angeles to San Francisco, Boston, Atlanta, Seattle and back to Los Angeles and San Francisco again! The two went on adventures in every city growing closer and closer. <br /><br />
        Until one day, Kerry devised an intricate surprised for Hera at her favorite place in the world, Disneyland. Though still shocked, Hera didn’t think twice before saying ‘yes.’ <br /><br />
        Now, they venture onto their next journey together in life as Mr. and Mrs. Kerry Young and Hera Kan, so please join them in celebrating their wedding. <br /><br />
