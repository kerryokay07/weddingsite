    <div class="bodyText">
        <h3 class="bodyText">Harley and Morgan met in 2009 during senior year of high school, during an Intro to Photography class. Students were assigned a project that required them to shoot architectural buildings throughout San Francisco. One afternoon, they ran into each other on the street - they were photographing the same building, just from different vantage points! - and decided to shoot together. The afternoon turned to evening and ended with ice cream, where they talked until the shop closed. And the rest, as they say, is history.<br/>In November, after dinner at Little Star (where they had their first "real" date!), Morgan surprised Harley by proposing in Buena Vista Park, where they often take their dog Luna for walks.<br/>They're so excited to start the next phase of their lives together and can't wait to celebrate with you in August!</h3>
